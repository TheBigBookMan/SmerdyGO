//* Skills To Learn- programming languages, music theory etc just a list off subset skills of each of these that I need to learn, making it more objective of what I need to learn- e.g (jazz theory for music, django- frontend connection for python)

const Music = () => {
  return (

      <h1>Music</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Music;
