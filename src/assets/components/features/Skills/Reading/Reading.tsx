//* Skills To Learn- programming languages, music theory etc just a list off subset skills of each of these that I need to learn, making it more objective of what I need to learn- e.g (jazz theory for music, django- frontend connection for python)
//* Books-to-read-- put the long list of books to read here so its a stable checkoff list- could connect it up to goodreads API so automatically updates

const Reading = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Reading</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Reading;
